This is a datapack for mod TARDIS REFINED. Adds a custome log theme desktop and also used Create for decoration. 

I didn't test what will happend if you change to this desktop without Create so it's **highly recommanded to have Create installed**. If you don't like the Create features you could also replace them with vanilla or from other mods' blocks by yourself.

The desktop includes a main lobby as controll room, a bedroom(don't forget to change the config file or your bed will explode when you're trying to sleep), a maximum enchanting table, a strorage and bath area, and of course the airlock. The four rooms are located on the corners(wired enough to say "corners of a circle") of the mian lobby.

The main structure and part of decorations are inpired by uploadaer from bilibili **蓝冰Gro**: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qy4y1r7Rf/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=a99f6d814ffdc59f10a4aec7311a93a0
